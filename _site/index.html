<p>Made a bunch of palettes but none of them are quite working with the tone of my typeface. I’m really sensitive to palettes and a lot of them hold an association to something, so it’ll take me some time to find the right one. I’m looking for something abstract… not able to labeled as tropical or earthy or whatever. Black and white with a pop of color is nice, but I think it’d be good to branch out and at least try something else.</p>

<p>The default of <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">this palette tool</a> also led me to generate 6-color palettes, which is more colors than I really need for my text-based website. The palettes also don’t communicate what the primary and secondary tones are. But it’s a start!</p>

<p>I wrote a simple Drawbot script to generate pattern specs for each character, but right now it involves manually entering each character. There’s a way to automate that. These are one way to judge the strength of each character’s color, texture, and composition in the part to whole relationship.</p>

<p>First digitized rought drafts of the typeface:</p>

<h6>— character set</h6>
<p><img src="images/01.12.19_draft1c.png" alt="" /></p>
<h6>— how it connects / how it splits apart</h6>

<p>Quite a ways to go! The zero tracking and leading version is meant to be the pattern configuration and the tracked out version is meant to be legible (to a degree — I’m not making an easy-on-the-eyes conventional body text). People are having trouble reading it though; it’s too sharp and some of the letters are just weird. It is kind of confusing to me when people think that the I is an O or the T is an R but I can’t argue with what they see.</p>

<p>The letters need to be massaged to be less rigorously geometric and a little more letter-like. I’m glad I worked on an extreme end though because it’s easier to pull back than tighten up.</p>

<p>The rigorous geometry also makes the face feel a little unsophisticated… I like the tone it carries but it’s not 100% likable yet. I also focused too much on the individual letters and lost a little bit of sight on the system. Sure they’re all composed of the same modules, but the flow is not there yet.</p>

<h6>— randomized words thanks to the <a href="http://robofontextensions.com/word-o-mat/">word-o-mat</a> Robofont extension</h6>

<p>The tricky thing is that a satisfying pattern requires a sense of symmetry and consistency, but legible words carry asymmetry and subtle variation. One point that is often said though is that the negative space and letter spacing play a huge role in readability.</p>

<p>This is all a fun puzzle with an interpretable set of rules. In the end, it’s all up to the eye’s judgement.</p>

<p>I was reading through my journal and found this from November 23, 2018. Seems like an appropriate start to this process log (though a couple of the next entries will be material from previous weeks):</p>

<p><em>It’s all on the tip of my tongue.</em></p>

<p><em>Taeyoon Choi writes of repetition as a form of the sublime. It’s perfect. The sublime just is. It’s not able to be articulated enough. To transcend code &amp; logical function is to create poetry.</em></p>

<p><em>So why a typeface? It captures all: repetition → evolution via permutation, individuality yet coherence, abstract image, fundamentally language. Logic &amp; legibility is also not enough; craft, love, &amp; beauty also transcend a typeface. Type is also potentially one of the most purely digital things. Using itself to create itself. Infinitely flat. Pure light &amp; optics. The written word is how anything is. Shapes that when combined become interpretable &amp; therefore meaningful. One can’t help but read.</em></p>
