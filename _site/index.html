<p>Generated a bunch of palettes but none of them are quite working with the tone of my typeface.</p>

<h3>1.30.19</h3>

<p>I was reading through my journal and found this from November 23, 2018. Seems like an appropriate start to this process log:</p>

<p><em>It’s all on the tip of my tongue.</em></p>

<p><em>Taeyoon Choi writes of repetition as a form of the sublime. It’s perfect. The sublime just is. It’s not able to be articulated enough. To transcend code &amp; logical function is to create poetry.</em></p>

<p><em>So why a typeface? It captures all: repetition → evolution via permutation, individuality yet coherence, abstract image, fundamentally language. Logic &amp; legibility is also not enough; craft, love, &amp; beauty also transcend a typeface. Type is also potentially one of the most purely digital things. Using itself to create itself. Infinitely flat. Pure light &amp; optics. The written word is how anything is. Shapes that when combined become interpretable &amp; therefore meaningful. One can’t help but read.</em></p>
