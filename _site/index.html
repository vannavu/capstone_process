<p>My self portrait, one of the first things I made after transferring into Sam Fox, still holds.</p>

<h6>January 2017</h6>

<p><span class="log_date">2.09.19</span></p>

<p>Made lilâ€™ refresh and printer icons to match Klimâ€™s Pitch Sans!</p>

<p class="fill"><img src="images/02.09.19_refresh.png" /><img src="images/02.09.19_print.png" /></p>

<p>I tested several monospace fonts to find one that matched Pitchâ€™s aesthetic and personality but that came with lining figures instead of oldstyle ones, but there really isnâ€™t anything that pairs as well with my typeface that also comes with arrows (Founders Grotesk Mono: if only it had arrows.) The proportions of Pitch are squarer than a lot of monospace faces and it just pairs well with the slight funkiness of my typeface. Looks like Pitch Sans Bold will be the first font I officially buy!</p>

<p>Gradual letter updates from the latest two Font Fridays:</p>

<p><img class="half_left" src="images/02.08.19_v0.1.jpg" /><img class="half_right" src="images/02.08.19_earz2.jpg" /></p>
<h6>left: old version, right: updated</h6>

<p>Not 100% sure about the new crossbar of the E, but itâ€™s better than the initial one which looks like Demetri Martinâ€™s nose. But really, the new crossbar is trying to match the new contrast system of thinned middles. Itâ€™s just awkward right now and looks like itâ€™s about to snap off, and Iâ€™m not sure it quite works in the pattern.</p>

<p><img src="images/02.08.19_earz7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h6>EARZ</h6>

<p>Also quickly tried some corner pieces (but it ainâ€™t gonna happen):</p>

<p><img src="images/02.08.19_corner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a name="02.07.19"></a></p>

<p><span class="log_date">2.07.19</span></p>

<p>Still got a lot more palettes to come up with to pick the top 4. Trying to test different forms of contrast (hue, value, saturation).</p>

<p class="fill"><img class="half_left" src="images/02.07.19_palette1.jpg" /><img class="half_right" src="images/02.07.19_palette2.jpg" /></p>
<h6>ðŸŒˆ left: more legible, right: pushing vibrancy</h6>

<p><a name="01.31.19"></a></p>

<p><span class="log_date">1.31.19</span></p>

<p><img src="images/01.31.19.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Still trying to figure out colors.</p>

<p><a name="01.27.19"></a></p>

<p><span class="log_date">1.27.19</span></p>

<p>Started adding some curves and smoother connections between strokes and the rigor of some of the other letters is starting to change. The letters are more legible and the words are more readable. But the pattern also improved now that the letters are more consistent to each other.</p>

<p><img class="half_left" src="images/01.27.19_c.jpg" /><img class="half_right" src="images/01.27.19_d.jpg" /></p>
<h6>left: old version, right: updated</h6>

<p>Iâ€™m still a little skeptical about whether or not the pattern is quite visible, but I think since I know the letters intimately I see the words immediately. Scale is also a factor but there may be too much of a 50/50 balance of positive and negative space.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also finding that the strength of the pattern depends on color choice to make foreground/background either ambiguous or distinct. Certain types of contrast can make shapes appear bigger (e.g. white against black vs black against white).</p>

<p class="fill"><img src="images/01.27.19_a.gif" class="half_left" /><img src="images/01.27.19_b.jpg" class="half_right" /></p>
<h6>red: flattened U / blue: rounded U</h6>

<p>I flattened the bottom of the U to create a consistent diamond shape in the pattern, but the round U may be an alternate for single-line typesetting.</p>

<p><span class="log_date">1.21.19</span></p>

<p class="fill"><img src="images/01.21.19_palettes.jpg" /></p>

<p>Made a bunch of palettes but none of them are quite working with the tone of my typeface. Iâ€™m really sensitive to palettes and a lot of them hold an association to something, so itâ€™ll take me some time to find the right one. Iâ€™m looking for something abstractâ€¦ not able to labeled as tropical or earthy or whatever. Black and white with a pop of color is nice, but I think itâ€™d be good to branch out and at least try something else.</p>

<p>The default of <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">this palette tool</a> also led me to generate 6-color palettes, which is more colors than I really need for my text-based website. The palettes also donâ€™t communicate what the primary and secondary tones are. But itâ€™s a start!</p>

<p><a name="01.16.19"></a></p>

<p><span class="log_date">1.16.19</span></p>

<p>I wrote a simple Drawbot script to generate pattern specs for each character, but right now it involves manually entering each character. Thereâ€™s a way to automate that. These are one way to judge the strength of each characterâ€™s color, texture, and composition in the part to whole relationship.</p>

<p><span class="log_date">1.12.19</span></p>

<p>First digitized rought drafts of the typeface:</p>

<h6>character set</h6>
<p><img src="images/01.12.19_draft1c.png" alt="" /></p>
<h6>how it connects / how it splits apart</h6>

<p>Quite a ways to go! The zero tracking and leading version is meant to be the pattern configuration and the tracked out version is meant to be legible (to a degree â€” Iâ€™m not making an easy-on-the-eyes conventional body text). People are having trouble reading it though; itâ€™s too sharp and some of the letters are just weird. It is kind of confusing to me when people think that the I is an O or the T is an R but I canâ€™t argue with what they see.</p>

<p>The letters need to be massaged to be less rigorously geometric and a little more letter-like. Iâ€™m glad I worked on an extreme end though because itâ€™s easier to pull back than tighten up.</p>

<p>The rigorous geometry also makes the face feel a little unsophisticatedâ€¦ I like the tone it carries but itâ€™s not 100% likable yet. I also focused too much on the individual letters and lost a little bit of sight on the system. Sure theyâ€™re all composed of the same modules, but the flow is not there yet.</p>

<h6>randomized words thanks to the <a href="http://robofontextensions.com/word-o-mat/">word-o-mat</a> Robofont extension</h6>

<p>The tricky thing is that a satisfying pattern requires a sense of symmetry and consistency, but legible words carry asymmetry and subtle variation. One point that is often said though is that the negative space and letter spacing play a huge role in readability.</p>

<p>This is all a fun puzzle with an interpretable set of rules. In the end, itâ€™s all up to the eyeâ€™s judgement.</p>

<p>I was reading through my journal and found this from November 23, 2018. Seems like an appropriate start to this process log (though a couple of the next entries will be material from previous weeks):</p>

<p><em>Itâ€™s all on the tip of my tongue.</em></p>

<p><em>Taeyoon Choi writes of repetition as a form of the sublime. Itâ€™s perfect. The sublime just is. Itâ€™s not able to be articulated enough. To transcend code &amp; logical function is to create poetry.</em></p>

<p><em>So why a typeface? It captures all: repetition â†’ evolution via permutation, individuality yet coherence, abstract image, fundamentally language. Logic &amp; legibility is also not enough; craft, love, &amp; beauty also transcend a typeface. Type is also potentially one of the most purely digital things. Using itself to create itself. Infinitely flat. Pure light &amp; optics. The written word is how anything is. Shapes that when combined become interpretable &amp; therefore meaningful. One canâ€™t help but read.</em></p>
