The working name for the font is now Sine, but I'm still not feeling it because of the strong mathematical connotation. I may change it to Sein which means “to be” in German. I am just not looking forward to questions of “why did you name it that?” I have a feeling that “why not” will be an insufficient answer to most people. I could rebut with “what would you name it” but I am not really feeling like being *that* person either.

Too much talk about feeling — what works?

Obviously I am just frustrated that I can't think of a good name. I am making excuses in case I end up with a mediocre one.

I have been thinking about nonsensical ones that sound the way the font looks. Like AZZA (huzzah?). Azzaazzaazzaazza. Which has led me to Zazz, as in pizzazz. Upon “research” of pizzazz and zazz, I am tentatively sold:

I have never described a pixel font as gross, but Syntax Zazz is gross. The person who made it has named themselves Font Bureau on dafont.com. Good god. Main point is there is not a font out there on the internet that's just called Zazz.

I am vibing with these definitions:

*Echoic of exuberant cry.* That is GREAT. ZAZZ IT UP. At one point I did want to name the font Echo but Typotheque beat me to it.
