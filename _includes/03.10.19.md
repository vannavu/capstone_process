Layout is still in prog, but the colors actually printed closer to how they look on screen than the laser printers at school. From a reasonable distance, the print quality is acceptable. Looking at these makes me wonder if they should resemble polaroids. Conceptually there is no meaning, but formally and mechanically it makes sense.

###### the 6 year old $30 inket still kicks

Everything is taking a chunk of time to get working, unsurprisingly, but it does make the payoff feel that much more satisfying. Formatting how a piece of the website prints is an opaque step above how HTML or CSS code will look. Also glad I don't have to buy ink. But I gotta buy paper so that it all ties into the website.

###### L: French Paper Grout Gray, R: website gray

Been looking through French Paper’s catalog, and Grout Gray looks like a perfect match for the gray I'm using on my website! Just debating what paper to get for my book, which I have yet to make a model of. Since the current idea is a cubular book, that requires a good chunk of paper and thus not a small amount of money for one book. Maybe I should make two so that someone can buy the second one… I feel like if I'm going for this sculptural artist book, everything has to go all out too. It should be archival. Or maybe people will actually pay $5 for my font. If just 10 people did that, that'd be nice. That would cover the cost I paid for one weight of Pitch Sans.

Hm.

I added a section to the website saying that typeface is available for download by email request. Someone said to put “for sale,” not just download. I mean, why not make it a free/pay-what-you-want font? I've heard people say to hide your first fonts in the depths and never sell it. It'd be a cool to see what people decide to make with it though. The whole point of a font is for someone to interpret it and use it. I do still want it to be mindfully distributed, that way people  know the context that this is not a retail font but a study in making type. There's a lot to learn from seeing how people use your type, too.
