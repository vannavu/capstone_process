The mistake I made with this book is that I have been *thinking* about it for over a month, but have not been *making* it. Classic mistake. Oof. The issue is that I don't clearly know what I want the book to say. I want it to be an expression of how my font can be used in a poetic way, but that's a vague goal.

The first compelling idea I thought of was to make a cubular book and to print a pattern on the fore-edges, along the idea of these books:  

<p class="fill"><img src="images/03.30.19.png"></p>

I forced myself to make some attempt at this book, so I wrote a DrawBot script for fore-edge printing:

<p><img class="half_left" src="images/03.30.19_a.jpg"><img class="half_right" src="images/03.30.19_b.jpg"></p>
###### book models, craft withheld

If the fore-edges were squares filled with text set in zero leading and letter spacing, the words would not be readable. Opening the book to a page would be an act of adding space to make the content legible. So it plays off that binary concept my website also has. But it feels like redundant idea. I want the book to say something else.

I was thinking of using Japanese stab binding since it shows off every fore-edge. My issue with that is that to me that binding is very tied to Japanese culture, so it always feels off to me when it's not used for such content. I've thought of trying to find more industrial materials in place of linen thread, like a thick, clear, rubber string. All of my thoughts have been very much about form, but I can't think of content. Last semester in bookbinding I got used to picking content for the binding type, which ended up working quite well. Usually one chooses a font to fit the content, so going the other way around is proving to be difficult, especially since I made the font.

I need to do more research on that to find what language will fill the pages. Writing my own content won't be quite possible at this point with the due date looming ahead. I also don't want to put out a book unless I believe in it, so this may be a summer project.

I rolled up the book model and taped it to make A Useless Object for a Useless Font. Then I made a bunch of dumb videos attempting to make the object useful, like calling it a 50-ply compostable straw. The form and language actually guided my decisions with those, but there's a reason why those videos were ephemeral Instagram stories and not on this blog :)
