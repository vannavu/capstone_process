###### how it connects / how it splits apart

Quite a ways to go! The zero tracking and leading version is meant to be the pattern configuration and the tracked out version is meant to be legible (to a degree â€” I'm not making an easy-on-the-eyes conventional body text). People are having trouble reading it though; it's too sharp and some of the letters are just weird. It is kind of confusing to me when people think that the I is an O or the T is an R but I can't argue with what they see.

The letters need to be massaged to be less rigorously geometric and a little more letter-like. I'm glad I worked on an extreme end though because it's easier to pull back than tighten up.

The rigorous geometry also makes the face feel a little unsophisticated... I like the tone it carries but it's not 100% likable yet. I also focused too much on the individual letters and lost a little bit of sight on the system. Sure they're all composed of the same modules, but the flow is not there yet.

The tricky thing is that a satisfying pattern requires a sense of symmetry and consistency, but legible words carry asymmetry and subtle variation. One point that is often said though is that the negative space and letter spacing play a huge role in readability.

This is all a fun puzzle with an interpretable set of rules. In the end, it's all up to the eye's judgement.
