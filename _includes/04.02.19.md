I am kind of stuck on how to write the *Letterform Structure* copy because my font technically isn't done. I am also wary of retroactively applying influences. And of accidentally writing an entire research essay instead of a digestible/accessible amount of content.

So I am using this blog to start writing, then I'll sculpt it from here.

Last summer for my internship I worked on a geometric slab serif. Those forms are ingrained in my head. It was a good way of studying basic serif construction/placement. Toward the end of my internship I thought of drawing a dumb super slab, and its initial physical manifestation was a birthday card for my brother.

Then at the start of last semester, we had a CSS typeface project (making type only with HTML and CSS). In one of the 3 intial sketches I took the super slab, cut off its slabs, and geometrized it.

I went with another direction for the CSS typeface, but spun off these forms for a window resize project that involved creating patterns with these geometric letterforms and transparency.

I made the grid into a 6x6 square since squares are more flexible for pattern making due to their greater range of symmetrical properties (rotational, symmetric, mirrored — both Zuzana Licko and Bram de Does talk about this in their patterns). Using proportions with rational numbers (e.g. 1:2, 3:4) also makes makes math and fitting easier.

I abstracted the letterforms even further by using squares, right triangles, and quarter-circles. As mentioned earlier in the blog, these forms are more like tangrams than letters. The current step is massaging these shape configurations into whole letterforms that also work within a pattern. Letterforms are nuanced but not necessarily strict. It's quite beautiful the way reading works. That is the human element to all typefaces: optics. It's why captchas exist.

Adding curvature to the letterforms also changes the tone of the font. I haven't thought of the right adjective for it, but the funk level is slightly increased. Monospaced and geometrically derived forms don't have to be rigid or sterile.

Well, I basically just wrote the outline for my copy… now I just need to add where the precedents fit in along with more images of how the font is structured to work as a pattern.
