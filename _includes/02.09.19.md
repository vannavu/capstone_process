Made lil' refresh and printer icons to match Klim's Pitch Sans!

I tested several monospace fonts to find one that matched Pitch's aesthetic and personality but that came with lining figures instead of oldstyle ones, but there really isn't anything that pairs as well with my typeface that also comes with arrows (Founders Grotesk Mono: if only it had arrows.) The proportions of Pitch are squarer than a lot of monospace faces and it just pairs well with the slight funkiness of my typeface. Looks like Pitch Sans Bold will be the first font I officially buy!

Also working on names. Oof. The placeholder name is MESH but it's not quite right. Perhaps AxZ?
