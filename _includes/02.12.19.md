The palettes are somewhat settled. The tricky things to work out are making yellow and light gray body text easy on the eyes, but I also don't want to make the global color changes cumbersome with a bunch of variables.

The new navigation setup is also too distracting and the hierarchies aren't quite right in differentiating between global and local. Thinking the icons are going to have to go too, though they were fun to make! Words are just more direct.
