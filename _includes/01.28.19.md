I hate the phrase “mood board.”

Here is visual research:

The current idea is to use color to highlight/visually prioritize the interactive elements, with black and white supporting the foundation.

###### type pairing tests / website structure ideas

The two website structure ideas revolved around space and microinteraction. The first: click → large plane to move around (like Google Maps). Second: scroll → long scroll page. After talking to some people about it, the idea of a responsive/flexible grid came up, like [this website](http://iad-lab.ch/){:target="_blank"}, which was presented last semester.
