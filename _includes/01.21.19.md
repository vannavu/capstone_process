Made a bunch of palettes but none of them are quite working with the tone of my typeface. I'm really sensitive to palettes and a lot of them hold an association to something, so it'll take me some time to find the right one. I'm looking for something abstract... not able to labeled as tropical or earthy or whatever. Black and white with a pop of color is nice, but I think it'd be good to branch out and at least try something else.

The default of [this palette tool](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) also led me to generate 6-color palettes, which is more colors than I really need for my text-based website. The palettes also don't communicate what the primary and secondary tones are. But it's a start!
