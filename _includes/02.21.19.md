Font Friday for this week was a Type Thursday. A lot of messing around to loosen up but also get somewhere, but I made a better I and X. The process has been a back and forth of sketching and vectorizing, I think because I'm still getting comfortable with drawing straight on the computer. At the end I'm going to scan all my sketches.

##### I & X<br>L: old, R: new

###### ZX — pretty pumped about this X

Some people also tried out the type tester. Naturally, the first thing they type is their name. Since the type tester is already so minimal and restricted, I'm not sure whether I should prompt people on what to type or just let them play around to figure out interesting combinations. The most interesting patterns I've made aren't with real words.
