### 1.30.19

I was reading through my journal and found this from November 23, 2018. Seems like an appropriate start to this process log:

*It's all on the tip of my tongue.*

*Taeyoon Choi writes of repetition as a form of the sublime. It's perfect. The sublime just is. It's not able to be articulated enough. To transcend code & logical function is to create poetry.*

*So why a typeface? It captures all: repetition &rarr; evolution via permutation, individuality yet coherence, abstract image, fundamentally language. Logic & legibility is also not enough; craft, love, & beauty also transcend a typeface. Type is also potentially one of the most purely digital things. Using itself to create itself. Infinitely flat. Pure light & optics. The written word is how anything is. Shapes that when combined become interpretable & therefore meaningful. One can't help but read.*
