##### — top: previous version<br>bottom: updated version

Started adding some curves and smoother connections between strokes and the rigor of some of the other letters is starting to change. The letters are more legible and the words are more readable. But the pattern also improved now that the letters are more consistent to each other.

I'm still a little skeptical about whether or not the pattern is quite visible, but I think since I know the letters intimately I see the words immediately. Scale is also a factor but there may be too much of a 50/50 balance of positive and negative space.

I'm also finding that the strength of the pattern depends on color choice to make foreground/background either ambiguous or distinct. Certain types of contrast can make shapes appear bigger (e.g. white against black vs black against white).

###### — red: flattened U / blue: rounded U

I flattened the bottom of the U to create a consistent diamond shape in the pattern, but the round U may be an alternate for single-line typesetting.
