First pass at the website deck: still thinking about what the discrete interactive elements will be and how they support the typeface. Right now they're not that strong as interactions and still quite default. Still working out the aesthetic and the color scheme, as well as the navigational and page structure.

###### not quite the right tones: elementary, tribal, ornamental/jewel-like, New Mexican; by the end of this session it simplified, per usual

In this draft the structure was based on edges, the critical areas of the typeface. Since this is also a minisite with a relatively small amount of content, I tried to play with an alternative navigational structure with the edge-wide menu sections (it'd be hard to get completely lost in such a simple site). However the logistics of building it would be needlessly complicated and the logic of its movement is confusing without a diagram of the thinking behind it—it's not clear enough or intriguing in the right way.

###### tangram puzzle to reveal structure rather than textually dictate it

Not really on board with these interactive elements since they don't do much to convey the typeface's concept—it's still very much being interactive for the sake of being interactive.

Onward!
