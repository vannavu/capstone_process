â€¦People like the deck! Main criticisms revolve around navigation and making things look like buttons. Excited to see everyone get to a point where we can all rally behind each other's projects.

Jonathan's critique on my first pass at the deck and small iteration after was to lean into a binary concept, as the typeface is for headline and pattern. After some sketching and looking back at website structure research, I got it. The split screen drives the concept and pushes me to think about how the two sides interact and how all the pieces are connected to each other.

The type tester completely serves the typeface now and really fits the context of this minisite better than a generalized type tester. It still allows people to see the type at different scales, too. By reducing the number of buttons and explicit variables, the typeface concept is reinforced and clearly communicated.

In the beginning, I was thinking about making postcards/business cards like the illustrators do to hand out at the capstone exhibition, but the idea was brought up to connect a printer to my laptop so people can print their own patterns they've made. It fits the context of the exhibition well and people get a takeaway/exit from the experience.
