Came up with a new T. The bulb/tear drop fits the tone, but I think it may be too pure of a shape? I'm getting better at forgetting the rules of the original system and not overthinking letters.

I'm also getting used to the O. It's not awful. Just need to smooth out the plateaus. People also keep saying they don't see much wrong with the font and that I should focus on the website. What?

We also had an in-class poster session, and everyone spat out some quick drafts. For me it was an excuse to make more patterny goodness. I don't want the poster to be a 1-to-1 of the website really. The poster is another opportunity to show the typographic potential of the font. I am having a lot of fun with these colors and letterforms!

Here are a handful:
