Today we presented our thinking so far on our capstones. I showed a lot of precedents to contextualize my project, explain why I'm doing it, and to give a sense of what the project *is* in the material sense.

The first question of my capstone is:

## How can I design a typeface that functions as ornamental pattern and legible word?

(Already shared the digitized drafts so I'll omit those)

The second question of my capstone is:

## How can I present a typeface's digital specimen and background information in tandem rather than in separate environments?

Many foundries split the specimen and design information into separate web pages, which makes sense since. As commercial foundries, they are addressing two different audiences.

Commercial Type made a whole [collection of interactive/responsive type specimen](http://showcase.commercialtype.com/){:target="_blank"} for each of their typefaces. It does the job of showing the typefaces various weights, etc., but content wise it is conceptually dissonant. At the core, this specimen follows traditional printed specimen in that the content doesn't have much to do with the typeface. But I mean, it's a fun playground, and it does push what a type specimen can be.

A very recent design is Grilli Type's Zirkon. This minisite separate from their home site's catalog. The minisite tells the story and process of the typeface and has animated diagrams. This is closest to what I have in mind for my website, though mine will have interactive elements that's are a bit different from the default type tester found on every foundry's site.

My initial proposal is:

## An engaging, rather than dry, informational narrative that integrates the type specimen and explains a type design's basis and structure.

Designed for type novices and people interested in type. Accessible — not overly scholarly, technical, or commercial.

###### tentative

—

A major question that comes is “what's the use of this typeface?” Immediately people demand a defined function for it, whether it be for a magazine, scarf, etc. Of course type gets used in unexpected ways and isn't married to the type designer's initial intent. To legitimize it to people though, it seems that one needs a practical medium for it. I have friction with that in regards to my font, because that's not how the idea for it came about. So retroactively applying an intended medium for it feels dishonest.

The whole point of my font is to explore the relationship between type design and pattern and to see what poetic and typographic possibilities arise from its formal qualities. I do not feel like I am designing a solution to a problem, but a program for solutions, as Karl Gerstner puts it. I am not making a tool, but a material for interpretation. In this project, I am not a marketing salesman.

As Kris Sowersby said about [Maelstrom](https://klim.co.nz/blog/maelstrom-design-information/){:target="_blank"}: “why does this perverse thing need to exist? … because it can.”

In this new year, I've started to carry the attitude of *why not?*
