Not 100% sure about the new crossbar of the E, but it's better than the initial one which looks like Demetri Martin's nose. But really, the new crossbar is trying to match the new contrast system of thinned middles. It's just awkward right now and looks like it's about to snap off, and I'm not sure it quite works in the pattern.
