There hasn't been much to update on since all I've been doing is debugging web code and just refining the physics of the website. I've been doing more reading, watching, and listening again about people's typefaces, especially in preparation for writing the copy explaining my typeface structure.

Kris Sowersby of Klim updated his [write-up of Maelstrom](https://klim.co.nz/blog/maelstrom-design-information/){:target="_blank"} after releasing the sans version, and lo and behold he linked to DJR's reverse contrast repository, [Backasswards](https://djr.com/backasswards/){:target="_blank"} 🙏 Never have I been so happy over a slideshow.

Update: found a video of DJR talking through the slides:
